# PCA and K-Means Clustering

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means Clustering. The notebook includes practical examples and visualizations for understanding these key unsupervised learning techniques.

## Overview

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: 
  - Reduces data dimensionality.
  - Visualizes high-dimensional data in lower dimensions.

- **K-Means Clustering**:
  - Groups data into clusters.
  - Provides visualizations of clustering results.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and open the notebook in Google Colab:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sunithakarr/unsupervised-learning-pca-kmeans.git

Go to Google Colab.
Click "File" -> "Open notebook".
Select the "GitHub" tab.
Enter the repository URL: https://github.com/Sunithakarri/unsupervised-learning-pca-kmeans.
Open the notebook and start exploring!
Dependencies
The notebook requires the following Python packages:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
seaborn
These dependencies can be installed directly within the Google Colab environment.
